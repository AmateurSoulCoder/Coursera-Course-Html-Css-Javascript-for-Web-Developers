        <div>HTML is a markup language. The word markup was used by editors who marked up manuscripts (usually with a blue pencil) when giving instructions for revisions. "Markup" now means something slightly different: a language with specific syntax that instructs a Web browser how to display a page. Once again, HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so on) from "presentation" (instructions for displaying each type of content). HTML uses a pre-defined set of elements to define content types. Elements contain one or more "tags" that contain or express content. Tags are enclosed by angle brackets, and the closing tag begins with a forward slash.</div>

            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describe the visual style and presentation of a document, most commonly web sites. One purpose of CSS is to separate the presentation of a document from the structure and content (although it is possible to embed CSS within the structure as well). This separation is a W3C standard recommendation. Separation of style from structure and content increases maintainability for the author(s) of a document as well as accessibility for the audience. CSS is commonly applied to HTML, XHTML and XML documents, though it is possible, albeit rare, to apply it to other types of documents as well.

            JavaScript is an interpreted computer programming language formalized in the ECMAScript language standard. JavaScript engines interpret and execute JavaScript. JavaScript engines may be designed for use as standalone interpretors, embedding in applications, or both. The first JavaScript engine was created by Netscape for embedding in their Web browser. V8 is a JavaScript engine created for use in Google Chrome and may also be used as a standalone interpretor. Adobe Flash uses a JavaScript engine called ActionScript for development of Flash programs.
